Work in progress.

### Credits:

* Based on [socketio-chat](https://glitch.com/~socketio-chat),
* Card deck is based on the [Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_playing_cards) one ([source](https://openclipart.org/detail/175474/swiss-card-deck-xvii)), but you can easily fork this and [define](https://go-fish.glitch.me/deck.json) your own.
